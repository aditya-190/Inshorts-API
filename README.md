## 📜 Description:
Inshorts API was built to support my android application - Inshorts Clone. This fetches latest 100+ news everyday using python and stores the data in JSON format in Firebase Realtime Database which is later used by the application to be displayed to the end user.
This handles paging of the website and fetches all the news are filtered so that no malformed data is stored in the database.

This is deployed on wayscipt where we have used cronjobs to schedule the script to run frequently.
